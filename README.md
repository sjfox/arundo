# Arundo R code for project

If you clone this repository onto your computer, it will create a folder with all of the code. I haveonly added the folders, but not the data. Ensure your folder is set up as such:


```
arundo/
    arundo_code/
    figs/
    data/
    .gitignore
    arundo.Rproj
    README.md
```

That means you will need to add in `data` and `figs` folders into the root folder. Then within the data folder, I have mine setup as:

```
data/
    CLASS_sensor_data.csv
    p1_sensor_data.csv
    sensor_data_transposed.csv
```

Where `p1_sensor_data.csv` is the cleaned and transposed column with only 6 columns, `sensor_data_transposed.csv` is the transposed version of the dataset, and `CLASS_sensor_data.csv` contains the original, unaltered version of the data.

You can also run the `arundo_data_read.R` script to create the necessary csvs so long as you have the `CLASS_sensor_data.csv` file in the `data/` folder.
